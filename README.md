Analysis of Engligh Premier Legaue game data versus requisite gambling predictions.

By analyzing datasets for the English Premier League and associated game betting data, 
we are looking to assess each team’s success against various betting standards, such as covering the spread, 
and winning bettors money. Further, our analysis may look additionally into the likelihood of a team winning when a 
certain referee is in charge of the match, or which referees are most likely to provide favorable betting outcomes. 

Preliminary questions:

Which teams are “winners” (in a betting sense)?

Which teams are “losers” (in a betting sense)?

What are the trends for specific teams across seasons? 
  Are there similar traits or characteristics about teams that make them “winners” or “losers?”
  
What impact do specific referees have on matches, from a betting perspective? 
  Do some referees have more favorable outcomes than others? 
    Team specific?
    
Is there a formula that can be derived which can predict, with a degree of certainty, the best games and teams to bet on?

Betting data does not appear to have been collected prior to 2000, so our analysis will use available data from 2000-2015.
